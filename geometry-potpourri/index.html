                <p>In this workbook, we're going to walk through a number of common geometric tasks
such as finding intersections, computing distances, performing rotations, etc. For each task, we'll
showcase not only the Klein code that would produce the desired result, but also show mathematically
how it can be computed by hand. Pen and paper is not only encouraged, it is likely a requirement to
get the most out of this workbook.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Lack of rigor ahead!</p>
<p>In this article, I make very little effort to explain why an operation is defined a certain way or explain some of the deeper underlying mathematics. This article was written because it's often helpful to see how computation is done first, and perform some calculations by hande as well gain some intuition before taking a closer look at the theory.</p>

<p>In this section, we look at all the various operations and elements that show up in <span class="arithmatex">\(\PGA\)</span>.
A common question that people run into when getting exposed to GA for the first time is, "why are
their so many operations?" The best answer is that, well, geometry has a lot of operations! More
than can be captured easily with just the dot product and cross product you're likely familiar with.
This section just gets you acquainted with the mechanics of <span class="arithmatex">\(\PGA\)</span>, but to glean more geometric
intuition, <em>all</em> the sections afteward will focus on concrete examples (plane distance to point,
meeting to points to make a line, projecting a line onto a plane, rotating a point about a line,
reflecting a point through a plane, etc). You'll find that for a bit of upfront complexity presented
here, what's gained is a satisfying degree of uniformity in all the geometry that comes later.</p>
<h3 id="pga-basis-and-geometric-product">PGA Basis and Geometric Product</h3>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>Klein API: <code>operator*</code></p>
<p>Written as two elements adjacent to each other (<span class="arithmatex">\(ab\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<p>Let's get used to some basis elements and operations first.
In <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbf{P}(\mathbb{R}^*_{3, 0, 1})\)</span> (also known as PGA), we have four grade-1 vector basis
elements, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_0\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_2\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_3\)</span>.
Let's define the square of these vectors in the following manner.
The first element squares to <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_0 \ee_0 =
0\)</span>) while the latter 3 elements square to <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_1\ee_1 = \ee_2\ee_2 = \ee_3\ee_3 = 1\)</span>).
As we now immediately have a means to create <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>, we can generate all the numbers this way,
so let's declare <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> as our grade-0 basis element.</p>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">Grade?</p>
<p>Very non-mathematically, the "grade" of an element is the number of subscripts it possesses.
Soon, you should get a good feel of what grades result from what operations, and what information
the grades present in a multivector quantity conveys.</p>
</div>
<p>When we write elements adjacent to one another as in <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_1\ee_1\)</span>, the operation being represented
here is the <em>geometric product</em>. In code, the geometric product is expressed as the multiplication
(<code>*</code>) operator. So far, we've written down what the geometric product does when the
elements multiply against themselves. Next, we need to describe what happens when we take the
geometric product between different elements.</p>
<p>Mixed products of the basis vectors produce the basis bivectors, which can themselves be used in
linear combinations to produce general bivectors. Bivectors that can be written as the product of
two vectors may be referred to as <em>blades</em> or <em>simple bivectors</em>. The products between basis vectors
are all blades by definition. As shorthand, we combine subscripts as shown
below:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ee_1\ee_0 &amp;= \ee_{10} \\
\ee_1\ee_2 &amp;= \ee_{12} \\
\ee_3\ee_0 &amp;= \ee_{30} \\
&amp;\dots
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>At the moment, we would have <span class="arithmatex">\(4\times 3 = 12\)</span> basis bivectors if defined this way, but we impose a
relation on them that relates basis bivectors that contain the same subscripts. Namely, the product
of two vectors is minus the product of the two vectors with the order interchanged.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ee_{01} &amp;= -\ee_{10} \\
\ee_{02} &amp;= -\ee_{20} \\
\ee_{03} &amp;= -\ee_{30} \\
\ee_{12} &amp;= -\ee_{21} \\
\ee_{31} &amp;= -\ee_{13} \\
\ee_{23} &amp;= -\ee_{32} \tag{1}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>For reasons that will become clear in a future writeup, we'll select the blades on the left hand side of <span class="arithmatex">\((1)\)</span> to be the
<em>canonical 2-blades</em> in PGA. There is some choice index order selection as will be explained later,
but the order here is used to match existing literature and so that computations later are made more
convenient.</p>
<p>Now that we know we can swap the order of the multiplication by basis vectors by introducing a sign,
we can compute things like <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{01}\ee_0\)</span>.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ee_{01}\ee_0 &amp;= \ee_0\ee_1\ee_0 \\
&amp;= -\ee_0\ee_0\ee_1 \\
&amp;= 0
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>Another example (that doesn't vanish):</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ee_{20}\ee_2 &amp;= \ee_2\ee_0\ee_2 \\
&amp;= -\ee_2\ee_2\ee_0 \\
&amp;= -\ee_0
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>The same algorithm can be used to produce the 4 trivectors:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ee_{123} &amp;= \ee_{12}\ee_3 = -\ee_{132} = \ee_{312} \\
\ee_{021} &amp;= \ee_{02}\ee_1 = -\ee_{201} = \ee_{210} \\
\ee_{013} &amp;= \ee_{01}\ee_3 = -\ee_{031} = \ee_{301} \\
\ee_{032} &amp;= \ee_{03}\ee_2 = -\ee_{302} = \ee_{320}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>Not all permutations were listed, but just a few so you can gain familiarity with swapping indices
and introducing signs or removing them as ncessary. The last element we haven't touched on is the
pseudoscalar <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{0123}\)</span>. The pseudoscalar is so named because while it does not have grade zero,
it is uniquely identified within its grade to within a permutation of its indices (compared to, say,
the grade-2 elements of which there are six distinct members).
Note that there is no way in which we can introduce an element with grade
higher than this, and so our <span class="arithmatex">\(16\)</span> algebra elements (1 scalar, 4 vector, 6 bivector, 4 trivector, and
1 pseudoscalar) are fully described. Linear combinations can be made from all of these elements to
produce a general multivector. To take the geometric product between general multivectors, we
leverage the fact that the geometric product obeys the distributive law.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
(4\ee_1 - 2\ee_{32})(3\ee_{012} + \ee_{10}) &amp;= 4\ee_1(3\ee_{012} + \ee_{10}) - 2\ee_{32}(3\ee_{012}
+ \ee_{10}) \\
&amp;= 12\ee_1\ee_{012} + 4\ee_1\ee_{10} - 6\ee_{32}\ee_{012} - 2\ee_{32}\ee_{10} \\
&amp;= -12\ee_{02} + 4\ee_0 - 6\ee_{301} - 2\ee_{3210} \\
&amp;= 4\ee_0 - 12\ee_{02} - 6\ee_{013} - 2\ee_{0123}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>In the last step, we simply took the time to sort the resulting terms by grade and also performed
swaps as necessary to write terms with the canonical subscript ordering.</p>

<h3 id="the-symmetric-inner-product">The Symmetric Inner Product</h3>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>Klein API: <code>operator|</code></p>
<p>Written as <span class="arithmatex">\(a \cdot b\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The <em>symmetric inner product</em> (inner product for short) is a bilinear binary operation like the
geometric product except
it <em>is always grade decreasing</em> such that the final grade is the absolute value of the difference of
the operand grades. If the grade of the element resulting from a geometric product
would have been greater than this difference, the inner product extinguishes it to zero. In other
words, all indices must contract for the inner product to produce a non-zero value (note that if the
degenerate element contracts, a zero is produced anyways).
Before, we
saw that the geometric product can decrease the grade in
the event that indices match (which contracts the result to <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span> depending). The easy way to
perform a symmetric product is to perform the geometric product as normal but discard terms produced
that produce the undesired grade. For example, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_1\cdot \ee_1 = 1\)</span> but <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_1\cdot
\ee_2 = 0\)</span>.
For a more nuanced example, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{12}\cdot\ee_{02}\)</span> is <em>also</em> <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span> because the <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> index did not contract.
Note that we write the symmetric inner product as <span class="arithmatex">\(\cdot\)</span> in equation form, but in code,
it is expressed via the pipe (<code>|</code>) operator. As with the geometric product, the symmetric inner
product obeys the distributive law. Here's an example mirroring an example above but using the inner
product instead of the geometric product:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[

<p>The <em>exterior product</em> (also known as the <em>wedge</em> product or the <em>outer</em> product) is similar to the
geometric product except it always extinguishes results upon contraction.
Thus, the result of an exterior product either has grade equal to the sum of the grades of its operands, or it
is exactly zero. The exterior product is represented in equations with a <span class="arithmatex">\(\wedge\)</span> symbol, and in
code, is represented with a caret (<code>^</code>) operator. The exterior product obeys the laws of distributivity as with the other products,
so let's return to our familiar example:</p>

<p>To perform the regressive product in the next section, we need a map that is <em>grade-reversing</em>. That
is, we need a map that takes multivectors <span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span> to multivectors <span class="arithmatex">\(v^*\)</span> such that the grade of <span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span> is
equal to <span class="arithmatex">\(4\)</span> minus the grade of <span class="arithmatex">\(v^*\)</span> (and vice versa). For example, vectors should be mapped to
trivectors, bivectors to bivectors, and the scalar to the pseudoscalar. In addition, this map needs
to be an involution (two application of the map is the identity). Here, a map is provided but note
that several such maps are possible. The nice property of the map provided here is that the
application of the map is just a coordinate tuple reversal without any sign changes. The mechanism for how this basis
was chosen is elegant but will be the subject of a different article. By convention, the dual

<p>A plane <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> <em>is the manifestation of a reflection</em>. It is often helpful not to think of a plane as a
"set of points" in PGA as will be evident when we look at rotations and translations later. Let's

<h4 id="planes-through-the-origin">Planes through the origin</h4>
<p>The plane represented implicitly by <span class="arithmatex">\(x = 0\)</span> appears in PGA simply as the vector <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_1\)</span>. Similarly,
the planes <span class="arithmatex">\(y = 0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(3z = 0\)</span> correspond to <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(3\ee_3\)</span> respectively. It's easy to see that

<p>Other planes like to the one above can be constructed similarly.</p>
<h4 id="angles-between-planes">Angles between planes</h4>
<p>The angle between planes is given by the inner product which produces the cosine of the angle
between them as you would expect. The planes must be normalized first for this to work, and the
norm of a plane <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> can be calculated as <span class="arithmatex">\(\sqrt{p\cdot p}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose we have two planes <span class="arithmatex">\(p_1 = 3\ee_0 + \ee_1 + \ee_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p_2 = \ee_0 + \ee_3\)</span>. The first plane we recognize as
<span class="arithmatex">\(x + z - 3 = 0\)</span>, a plane parallel to the y-axis that passes through the points
<span class="arithmatex">\((0, y, 3)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((3, y, 0)\)</span> for any value of <span class="arithmatex">\(y\)</span>. The second plane the plane <span class="arithmatex">\(z + 1 = 0\)</span> which is
parallel to the <span class="arithmatex">\(xy\)</span>-plane and intercepts the <span class="arithmatex">\(z\)</span>-axis one unit below the origin. We expect the
angle between these planes to be <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> radians, so let's quickly verify this with the
inner product. First though, we must normalize them by dividing by the norm. This gives:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
p_1 &amp;= \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\ee_0 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\ee_1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\ee_3 \\
p_2 &amp;= \ee_0 + \ee_3
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>Remember that when computing the norm, because <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_0^2 = 0\)</span>, the <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_0\)</span> component does not
participate in the computaiton. The angle between them is then computed as:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
    p_1 \cdot p_2  &amp;= \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\ee_0 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\ee_1 +
    \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\ee_3\right) \cdot (\ee_0 + \ee_3) \\
    &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\ee_3\cdot\ee_3 \\
    &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>indicating that the angle between <span class="arithmatex">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p_2\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\(\cos^{-1}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> radians. The Klein code to

<p>The "meet" operation in <span class="arithmatex">\(\PGA\)</span> is defined in terms of the exterior product (<span class="arithmatex">\(\wedge\)</span>). Given two
planes, <span class="arithmatex">\(p_1 = 3\ee_0 + \ee_1 + \ee_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p_2 = \ee_0 + \ee_3\)</span>, we can compute the exterior

\]</div>
<p>How can we verify that this is correct? Well, let's first try to calculate the equation of this line
using more traditional means. In classical Euclidean geometry, the six degrees of freedom of a line
are often represented using Plücker coordinates. Let's express our planes using the implicit
equation form:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
0 &amp;= 3 + x + z \\
0 &amp;= 1 + z
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>The Plücker displacement is determined by the cross product of the plane normals, which in this case
is the cross product <span class="arithmatex">\((\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{k})\times\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{i}\times\mathbf{k} =
-\mathbf{j}\)</span>. Meanwhile, the Plücker moment of the line is given as <span class="arithmatex">\(3\mathbf{k} - (\mathbf{i} +
\mathbf{k}) = -\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{k}\)</span>. Putting it together, the Plücker coordinate tuple of our
line is <span class="arithmatex">\((d_1:d_2:d_3:m_1:m_2:m_3) = (0: -1: 0:-1:0:2)\)</span>, in exact accordance with the calculation
above.</p>
<p>Observe that the coordinates associated with <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{21}\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{13}\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{32}\)</span> capture the
information about the orientation of the line, while the coordinates associated with <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{01}\)</span>,
<span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{02}\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{03}\)</span> work in tandem to impart a translational element as well.</p>
<p>What happens if the planes are parallel? Let's try our meet between planes <span class="arithmatex">\(-2\ee_0 + 2\ee_1\)</span> and
<span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_1\)</span> to see what happens.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ (-2\ee_0 + 2\ee_1) \wedge \ee_1 = -2\ee_{01} \]</div>
<p>We ended up with a bivector all the same! Quantities that have no direction components like the
above are referred to as <em>ideal lines</em>, also known as <em>lines at infinity</em>. What's important about
concepts like lines and points at infinity is that their existence allows our algebra to have
<em>closure</em> without needing to introduce vague notions of <span class="arithmatex">\(\infty\)</span>. Another way to word this is to say
that planes <em>always</em> intersect, even when parallel, and the algebra does not need to make any
special exceptions for them. Furthermore, these entities at infinity have uses! We'll see later that
rotations about ideal lines can be used to generate translations.</p>

<p>With the same meet operation (<span class="arithmatex">\(\wedge\)</span>) we used to intersect two planes to construct a line, we can
intersect a line and a plane to construct a point. Let's use the line <span class="arithmatex">\(\ell = -\ee_{01} + 2\ee_{03} -

<p>In the last step, we divided the expression by <span class="arithmatex">\(-1\)</span> so that the weight of <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{123}\)</span> is exactly one.
For points, this weight is the homogeneous coordinate, and when it is unity, there is a direct
association between the point's Cartesian coordinates and the other trivector weights. For <span class="arithmatex">\(\PGA\)</span>,
given a normalized point with <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{123}\)</span> weight <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>, the <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> coordinate is the weight of the
<span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{032}\)</span> trivector, the <span class="arithmatex">\(y\)</span> coordinate is the weight of the <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{013}\)</span> trivector, and the <span class="arithmatex">\(z\)</span>
coordinate is the weight of the <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{021}\)</span> trivector.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Projective equivalence</p>
<p>In projective geometry, all geometric entities (planes, lines, points) exhibit a property known as

non-zero real scalar <span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span>. To compare weights from one entity to another meaningfully however, we
tend to use this projective equivalence to keep things normalized in the same way. For example, it
doesn't make sense to compare the <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{021}\)</span> weight (the <span class="arithmatex">\(z\)</span>-coordinate) between two points unless
they are both normalized in the same manner.</p>

this point is the intersection we're seeking?

<li>As mentioned previously, the exterior product is only anticommutative in certain situations. This isn't one of them!
   In fact, it would be somewhat concerning if the point intersection depended on the order <span class="arithmatex">\(\ell \wedge p\)</span> vs <span class="arithmatex">\(p \wedge \ell\)</span>.
   Evaluate <span class="arithmatex">\(p \wedge \ell\)</span> for the above example and verify that you get the same result.</li>
<li>Seeing points as trivectors might feel a bit confusing at first. This isn't so much an exercise, but a request for
   you, the reader, to reserve any doubts that the representation makes sense until we look at the geometric product
   in view of symmetric actions.</li>
<li>Here, we met a line and a plane to get the point of intersection point. Three planes can be met with the same operator <span class="arithmatex">\(\wedge\)</span>
   to produce the intersection point as well. Can you see why?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="joins">Joins</h3>
<p>In the constructions above, we used the exterior product to <em>meet</em> entities to elegantly construct
intersections. The <span class="arithmatex">\(\wedge\)</span> operator is a grade-increasing operation that allowed us to go from
planes to lines to points. What about going the other direction? Well, there's a handy tool for
that! Earlier, we learned about the <a href="#regressive-product">Regressive Product</a>, defined <em>in terms</em> of
the exterior product on the duals of the operands. As a result, it should be evident that the
regressive product is a <em>grade decreasing</em> operation that allows us to <em>join</em> entities to go in the
other direction, from points to lines to planes.</p>
<p>Sure enough, this works exactly as you'd expect. Two points can be joined to construct a line, and
a line and a point (or equivalently three points) can be joined to create a plane. Here's a code
snippet doing exactly this.</p>

<h2 id="projection-rejection-containment">Projection, Rejection, Containment</h2>
<p>A common question is how to compute whether a point lies on a line or plane, or whether a line lies on a plane.
When examining the implicit forms of lines and planes, the answer is obvious. For example, given a
plane <span class="arithmatex">\(0 = ax + by + cz + d\)</span>, points that lie on the plane are simply coordinate tuples that satisfy
the implicit equation. In GA, coordinates are "substituted" in this manner, and we need a way to
express projection/rejection/containment in terms of the algebraic operations available to us. The
key is to use the symmetric inner product to perform metric "measurements". Let's consider the
various cases separately.</p>
<h3 id="point-to-plane">Point to plane</h3>
<p>Let's consider a point <span class="arithmatex">\(P = \ee_{123} + 2\ee_{032} + \ee_{013}\)</span> and a plane <span class="arithmatex">\(p = 3\ee_0 + \ee_1\)</span>. The inner
product between them is computed as:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
P \cdot p &amp;= (\ee_{123} + 2\ee_{032} + \ee_{013}) \cdot (3\ee_0 + \ee_1) \\
&amp;= \ee_{23} - \ee_{03}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>This is the line perpendicular to the plane through the point. A way to intuitively see why this is
so is to observe the fact that the inner product contracts indices, leaving only the parts that are
not in common between the two. As a result, not only does the inner product produce a bivector, each
corresponding term in the bivector produced contains indices not present in the plane. Can we now
compute the distance between the point and the plane?</p>
<p>The answer is <em>no</em>. Notice how in the above expression, the weight of <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_0\)</span> of the plane didn't
participate in the calculation at all. This means that translating the plane towards or away from
the origin doesn't effect its inner product with a point, indicating that the line cannot be used to
compute the distance between a point and a plane. Note that whether or not the plane was normalized
made no difference.</p>
<p>Before continuing, let's quickly see what would have happened if we computed <span class="arithmatex">\(p \cdot P\)</span> instead of
<span class="arithmatex">\(P \cdot p\)</span>.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
p \cdot P &amp;= (3\ee_0 + \ee_1) \cdot (\ee_{123} + 2\ee_{032} + \ee_{013}) \\
    &amp;= \ee_{23} - \ee_{03}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>Conveniently, the results match!</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercises</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you justify the equality between <span class="arithmatex">\(p\cdot P\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(P \cdot p\)</span>?</li>
<li>In the example above, the line produced by the inner product has a translational component. Where did that component come from?</li>
<li>Can you see how the translational component of the produced line changes when we shift the position of the point?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>To compute the distance from the point to the plane, we need to use an operator that doesn't
annihilate the translational component of the plane. The answer is to use the <em>either</em> the join
(<span class="arithmatex">\(\vee\)</span>) or meet (<span class="arithmatex">\(\wedge\)</span>) operator to construct the metric-free quantity from which we can extract the
distance by inspecting the magnitudes. Let's compute both to see what we come up with:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
P \wedge p &amp;= (\ee_{123} + 2\ee_{032} + \ee_{013}) \wedge (3\ee_0 + \ee_1) \\
&amp;= -3\ee_{0123} - 2\ee_{0123} \\
&amp;= -5\ee_{0123}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
P \vee p &amp;= (\ee_{123} + 2\ee_{032} + \ee_{013}) \vee (3\ee_0 + \ee_1) \\
&amp;= \JJ\left((\ee_0 + 2\ee_1 + \ee_2) \wedge (3\ee_{123} + \ee_{032})\right) \\
&amp;= \JJ\left(3\ee_{0123} + 2\ee_{0123}\right) \\
&amp;= \JJ\left(5 \ee_{0123}\right) \\
&amp;= 5
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>The <em>ideal norm</em> (norm computed with only elements containing subscript <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span>) of the meet matches the
norm of the join which encodes the distance from the point to the plane.
As an equation, we'd express the ideal norm as <span class="arithmatex">\(||P\wedge p||_\infty\)</span>.
Let's check if this is right! The plane <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> corresponds to <span class="arithmatex">\(0 = x + 3\)</span> and the point <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> corresponds
to the coordinate tuple <span class="arithmatex">\((2, 1, 0)\)</span>. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_plane">point-to-plane distance</a> formula
tells us that the distance between <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> is, in fact, <span class="arithmatex">\(5\)</span>, in agreement with our point-plane
meet and join calculation. To understand why this works, pay attention to which terms survived the
meet and the join. The point's homogeneous component paired with the plane's translational
component, and all the plane's direction components paired with the point's positional components.
Geometrically, we've projected the point onto the normal direction of the plane and subsequently
taken the norm which included the plane's translation from the origin.</p>
<p>To compute this distance in Klein, given a point <code>P</code> and plane <code>p</code>, we'd simply do
<code>std::abs((p ^ P).e0123())</code>. Alternatively, we could do <code>std::abs((p &amp; P).scalar())</code>.
Of course, you <em>must</em> normalize the plane with <code>p.normalize()</code> for this computation to work.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercises</p>
<ol>
<li>The above computation worked because the plane <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> was normalized such that <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2 = 1\)</span>. Change the normalization factor or change <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> itself and verify that normalization is required for the distance measure above to work.</li>
<li>Considering the meet and join operators, does it make sense that the meet and join of a point and plane produced the pseudoscalar and scalar respectively?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>What about the line perpendicular to the plane through the point <span class="arithmatex">\(P\cdot p\)</span>? It can't be used to
measure the distance to the plane as we pointed out before, but it <em>can</em> be used to project the
point to the plane. The succinct formula for this projection is <span class="arithmatex">\((p \cdot P)P\)</span>.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
(p\cdot P)P &amp;= (\ee_{23} - \ee_{03})(3\ee_0 + \ee_1) \\
&amp;= 3\ee_{023} + \ee_{123} - \ee_{031} \\

\]</div>
<p>which corresponds to the point <span class="arithmatex">\((-3, 1, 0)\)</span>. That this point lies on the plane is immediate. Also,
this point is <span class="arithmatex">\(5\)</span> units away from <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> and the line between them is parallel to the <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> axis,
indicating that we have indeed projected the point to the plane. Klein code that computes this
projection is shown below:</p>

<h3 id="line-to-plane">Line to plane</h3>
<p>Another potential projection we should consider is projecting a line to a plane. Without proof,
the equation projecting <span class="arithmatex">\(\ell\)</span> onto <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\((p\cdot \ell)p\)</span>. Before trying this out, let's check the
dimensionality first. The expression <span class="arithmatex">\(p\cdot\ell\)</span> will produce a vector quantity, but the geometric
product of two vectors doesn't necessarily produce a bivector (there could be scalar components).
The "trick" is to realize that because the inner product contracts all subscripts, the vector
produced by <span class="arithmatex">\(p\cdot \ell\)</span> will be completely orthogonal to both <span class="arithmatex">\(\ell\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, so we are justified
in claiming that the final result <span class="arithmatex">\((p\cdot \ell)p\)</span> is a bivector, meaning that this formula does, in
fact, produce a line.</p>
<p>Let's consider the line <span class="arithmatex">\(\ell = \ee_{32} + \ee_{13}\)</span> (you should recognize this line as a line
through the origin between the <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(y\)</span> axes). The projection onto the plane
<span class="arithmatex">\(p = 3\ee_0 + \ee_1\)</span> should clearly be the <span class="arithmatex">\(y\)</span> axis shifted <span class="arithmatex">\(3\)</span> units so let's verify that this is
the case:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
(p \cdot \ell)p &amp;= \left((3\ee_0 + \ee_1)\cdot(\ee_{32} + \ee_{13})\right) p \\
&amp;= \ee_{3}(3\ee_0 + \ee_1) \\
&amp;= -3\ee_{03} - \ee_{13}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>At first glance, this doesn't seem like the line that we want, but we must remember that
projectively, the lines <span class="arithmatex">\(3\ee_{03} + \ee_{13}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(-3\ee_{03} - \ee_{13}\)</span> are projectively
equivalent. In Klein, we can produce this projection as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">kln</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">plane</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">};</span>

<h3 id="point-to-line">Point to line</h3>
<p>With the point and a line, two reasonable questions to ask are, as with the plane, how to compute
the distance to the line, and how to project the point onto the line. Before continuing, guess what
the formulae should be!</p>
<details class="tip"><summary>Guess! Then click to reveal spoilers</summary><p>If you thought the distance between the point and the line is <span class="arithmatex">\(||P\vee \ell||\)</span> and the projection is <span class="arithmatex">\((P\cdot \ell)\ell\)</span>, you'd be right! The uniformity between this equation and all the others we've seen should be quite satisfying. Note that the point must be normalized so that the weight of <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{123} = 1\)</span> and the line must be normalized so that the square norm of the directional components is unity for these formulae to work.</p>
<p>In Klein, given a point <code>P</code> and line <code>l</code>, the projection is <code>kln::point P_on_l{(P|l) * l}</code> as you would expect.</p>
</details>
<p>The projection is somewhat straightforward, but perhaps the distance formula may take some
additional processing. First, let's consider the join <span class="arithmatex">\(P\vee\ell\)</span>. What type of quantity does this
produce? Well, from the section detailing the <a href="#regressive-product">regressive product</a> above, we
know that his is a plane containing both the point and the line. It turns out that the norm of this
plane will encode the distance between the point and the line.
Let's see how this works for the line <span class="arithmatex">\(\ell = \ee_{02} + \ee_{23}\)</span> and point
<span class="arithmatex">\(P = \ee_{123} + \ee_{013} + \ee_{021}\)</span> (we expect the distance to be <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>).</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
||P\vee \ell|| &amp;= ||(\ee_{123} + \ee_{013} + \ee_{021})\vee (\ee_{02} + \ee_{23})|| \\

&amp;= ||-\ee_3 + \ee_0|| \\
&amp;= 1
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>If you have trouble remembering how lines are defined, remember that terms containing a <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span> in the
subscript are translational components (the moment of the line) and the remaining terms determine
the line's direction. The line <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_{02} + \ee_{23}\)</span> can be decomposed as the meet of two
planes <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_0 - \ee_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\ee_2\)</span> so we can intuit that the line is the <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> axis shifted a unit in
the <span class="arithmatex">\(+z\)</span> direction. The norm of a point is just the homogeneous coordinate. Code computing the
distance between a point and a line looks like:</p>
